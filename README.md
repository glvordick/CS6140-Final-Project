# CS6140 Final Project
This project was completed by Gabriel Vordick and Chirag Tagadiya. The data needed is from a Kaggle competition called M5 Forecasting. The files are over 100MB and cannot be added to this repository. I would recommend going to the competition website to download the data if you wish to run the Models: https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy
